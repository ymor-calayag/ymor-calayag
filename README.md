I’m an aspiring developer who is open to work and continuously learning Python. I enjoy building small personal projects to strengthen my programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills.

**🚧 What I’m Currently Working On**

I’m actively learning Python by creating small personal projects, including:
<table>

  </tr>
  <tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="left">🔢 Number Guessing Game</td>
    <td align="left">📊 Higher Lower Game</td>

</table>


More projects will be added as I continue learning and improving.

**🛠 Tools & Technologies**
